# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB and Twitter Datasets

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB and Twitter datasets using multiple NLP tools and libraries, including Hugging Face Transformers, VADER, and TextBlob. The aim is to compare the performance of these tools and analyze the sentiment of various texts from the datasets.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used for understanding opinions in social media, reviews, and more. This project implements sentiment analysis using three different tools:

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained models such as BERT and RoBERTa.
- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.
- **TextBlob**: A simple library for processing textual data, which provides a simple API for diving into common NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews dataset.
- Sentiment analysis on Twitter dataset.
- Comparison of results across different sentiment analysis tools.
- Visualizations to understand the performance of different models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary libraries like `transformers`, `vaderSentiment`, `textblob`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.

## Usage

1. **Download the Datasets**:

   - IMDB: [Download link](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
   - Twitter: You can use Twitter API to scrape tweets or use an existing dataset from sources like Kaggle.

2. **Preprocess the Data**:

   Ensure the datasets are cleaned and preprocessed according to the needs of the different sentiment analysis models.

3. **Run Sentiment Analysis**:

   - Using Hugging Face:

     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline

     classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
     result = classifier("I love this movie!")
     ```

   - Using VADER:

     ```python
     from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

     analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
     result = analyzer.polarity_scores("I love this movie!")
     ```

   - Using TextBlob:

     ```python
     from textblob import TextBlob

     blob = TextBlob("I love this movie!")
     result = blob.sentiment
     ```

4. **Compare the Results**:

   Evaluate and compare the results from different models to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Dataset

### IMDB Dataset

The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. It is a commonly used dataset for sentiment analysis tasks.

### Twitter Dataset

The Twitter dataset can be composed of tweets labeled with sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). You can create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets.

## Model Overview

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, etc.
- **VADER**: Designed for social media sentiment analysis; it performs well on short, informal texts.
- **TextBlob**: A simple and easy-to-use library for basic NLP tasks including sentiment analysis.

## Results

- Visualization and comparison of sentiment analysis results across the different models.
- Insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
